main_file.py is the coordinating .py file for the app.

This app sorts the large volume of images and videos from a source folder and copies in to the destination folder by Year and Month wise.
It uses the name of the file for taking the date_stamp. If the name of the file doesn't contain such data, exif data is extracted to perform the above operation.

The coding will be naive, the users here may check and help in improving it.
